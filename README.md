AppIconPhishing
======================

This is a simple app to demonstrate the efficiency of Android application icon phishing. 
The app will replace the Google Play as AppIconPhishing.
You can refer to [Occupy Your Icons Silently on Android](http://www.fireeye.com/blog/uncategorized/2014/04/occupy_your_icons_silently_on_android.html) for the detail.

Usage
-----------------------
1. Install this application to your device(I test it on Nexus 7 and try to replace the Google Play, 
you can change the victim app in the source code as you wish, just make sure that the victim app's 
icon is already on the home screen.) and drag its icon to the home screen. 
2. Run AppIconPhishing and then you can click the victim app's icon on the home screen.
If everything is OK, you will find the AppIconPhishing activity starts instead.
